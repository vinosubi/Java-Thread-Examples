# ExecutorService

`ExecutorService:`

**Whats exactly concurrency ?**
Concurrency is the ability of a system to manage multiple tasks simultaneously. It is essential for improving the performance and responsiveness of the system.

An **ExecutorService** is a utility in Java that provides a way to execute tasks concurrently.
It manages a pool of worker threads, and allows you to submit tasks for execution.
The ExecutorService handles creation, management, and reusability of threads, making it easier to handle concurrent tasks in multithreaded applications.

Starting from Java 5, JDK provides API ExecutorService that simplifies running tasks in asynchronous mode. It provides a pool of threads and an API to assign tasks to it.

ExecutorService is an interface provided by JDK. Its object can be obtained using class Executors. There are 5 types of thread pools we can create

```java
1. ExecutorService execService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor(10);
 ```
 Creates an Executor that uses a single thread
 
 **SingleThreadedExecutor :** It is similar to a fixed thread executor, but the size of the blocking queue is 1. In this case if the thread is killed because of an exception, a new thread is created. It is used when we want to make sure of the order of execution (sequentially).

```java
2. ExecutorService execService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
```
 Creates a thread pool that reuses a fixed number of threads
 
**Fixed Thread Pool:** We have fixed number of threads which pick up tasks assigned to it. All tasks are stored in a thread safe blocking queue.


```java
3. ExecutorService execService = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(10);
```
 Creates a thread pool that can schedule commands to run after a given delay, or to execute periodically.
 
**ScheduledThreadPool:** It is used for tasks which need to be scheduled after a delay. We can configure a one-off delay, or a periodic schedule, or even a schedule with a fixed delay. A delay queue is used here, because of which the order of tasks is not in order.


```java
4. ExecutorService execService = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
```
 Creates a thread pool that creates new threads as needed, but will reuse previously constructed threads when they are available.
 
**CachedThreadPool:** We do not have a fixed number of threads here. The blocking queue is replaced by a synchronous queue which only has space for one task. A new request is stored in the queue while it searches for any available thread. If no thread is available then itâ€™ll create a new thread and add it to the pool. It also has the ability to kill threads which have been idle for more than 60 seconds.


```java
5. ExecutorService execService = Executors.newWorkStealingPool();
```
Creates a work-stealing thread pool using all available processors as its target parallelism level

Once the thread pool is created, we can perform the required action on them. Most used methods and their functionalities are as below:

- **execute(Runnable) :** Executes the given command at some time in the future. It does not return anything.
- **submit(Runnable) :** executes the passed task and returns a Future Object representing the executed task.This method accepts a Runnable task for execution and returns a Future object representing that task. Since a Runnable does not return a result, the returned Future's get method will return null upon successful completion.
- **submit(Callable) :** The Callable interface is similar to Runnable, but it can return a result and throw a checked exception. It is a generic interface with a single method call that returns a result of type V..
- **invokeAll(Collection<? extends Callable<T>> tasks):** Executes the given tasks, returning a list of Futures holding their status and results when all complete.
- **invokeAny(Collection<? extends Callable<T>> tasks):** Executes the given tasks, returning the result of one that has completed successfully (i.e., without throwing an exception), if any do.
- **awaitTermination(long timeout, TimeUnit unit):** Blocks until all tasks have completed execution after a shutdown request, or the timeout - occurs, or the current thread is interrupted, whichever happens first.
- **isShutdown():** Returns true if this executor has been shut down.
-** isTerminated():** Returns true if all tasks have been completed following shut down.
-** shutdown() :** Initiates the shutdown so that previously submitted tasks are executed, but no new task will be accepted. Invocation has no additional effect if already shut down.
- **shutdownNow() :** Attempts to stop all actively executing tasks, halts the processing of waiting tasks, and returns a list of the tasks that were awaiting execution.

### Example 1 Execute Method : Using ExecutorService to Execute a Runnable

```java

package com.vino.info.example.executorService;

import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
public class Example1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an ExecutorService with a fixed thread pool of size 2
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        // Create an instance of the Runnable task
        MyRunnableTask task = new MyRunnableTask();

        // Submit the task to the executor for execution
        executorService.execute(task);

        // Properly shut down the executor
        executorService.shutdown();
    }
}

class MyRunnableTask implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Task is running in: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

```
### Example 2 Execute Method : This Example that includes creating multiple Runnable tasks, submitting them to an ExecutorService, and demonstrating how the tasks are executed concurrently.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class ExecutorServiceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an ExecutorService with a fixed thread pool of size 3
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        // Submit multiple tasks to the executor
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            executorService.execute(new MyRunnableTask(i));
        }

        // Properly shut down the executor
        executorService.shutdown();
    }
}

public class MyRunnableTask implements Runnable {
    private final int taskId;

    public MyRunnableTask(int taskId) {
        this.taskId = taskId;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " is running in: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        try {
            // Simulate some work with a sleep
            Thread.sleep(2000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            System.err.println("Task " + taskId + " was interrupted.");
        }
        System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " is completed in: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

```
